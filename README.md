Reflection on Projects One and Two

The DriverPass project was about creating a system for a small company that wanted to help people get ready for their driving tests. The client, DriverPass, needed a web-based system that would let students sign up, practice
with online tests, schedule driving lessons, and track their progress. Basically, they wanted one system that could handle everything from learning to booking time with an instructor.

I think I did really well in laying out the business requirements. I made sure the client’s needs were clear and that they were broken down into pieces that could actually be designed and built. That part came together
smoothly and gave me a good foundation for the system design later on.

If I could go back and change one thing, I would spend more time improving my diagrams in the system design document. They worked, but I know I could have made them cleaner and easier to read if I paid more attention to
consistency and formatting. That would have made them stronger, especially for people who aren’t as technical.

When I was working on the design, I tried to always think about the user’s point of view. The client wanted something reliable and simple for students and staff to use, so I made sure to include features that matched that.
It’s really important to think about user needs because if the system doesn’t make sense to the people who are actually using it, then it’s not going to succeed no matter how advanced the technology is.

For me, designing software starts with understanding the requirements and then mapping them into use cases and diagrams before thinking about the technical side. In the future, I’d like to keep using those techniques, but
I’d also focus more on getting feedback throughout the process so I can make small improvements as I go. I think that would make my designs even stronger and more useful.
